#1.Create a Python script called playlist_stats.py that takes a list of daily Spotify song
#  play counts (e.g., [120, 135, 150, 200, 120, 90, 200]) and calculates the mean (average) 
# number of plays.

'''import  pandas as pd

playlist_stats = [120, 135, 150, 200, 120, 90, 200]
result = pd.Series(playlist_stats).mean()
print(result)

# 2.Given the following array of delivery times (in minutes) for Zomato orders: 
# [30, 25, 40, 35, 30, 45, 30], write code to find the median delivery time and print it.

'''import pandas as pd

#3.Write a function most_common_rating(ratings) that takes a list of Flipkart product ratings 
# (e.g., [5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 4, 2, 4]) and returns the mode (most frequent rating)

#4.Given three lists representing YouTube video views for three different channels, 
# compare the mean, median, and mode for each channel, and decide which channel's data is 
# most affected by outliers.Hint: Try using one list with a very 
# high value (e.g., [100, 120, 110, 105, 5000]) to see the effect on mean vs median.
